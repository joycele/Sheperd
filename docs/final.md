### Project Summary
The goal of this project is to use reinforcement learning methods to teach a Minecraft bot how to herd sheep. In particular, we chose to leverage tabular q-learning and deep q-learning to teach the agent how to efficiently gather a number of sheep in an arena and lead them to a designated pen on the outside of the arena. The reason for this is to bolster the difficulty of a trivial problem to one that requires methods and insights beyond that of a programmatic solution, much like a real world situation. More realistic situations could possibly include different kinds of terrain, time constraints; finishing before nightfall to avoid mobs, and larger distances. In the final phase of our project, we used a deterministic and discrete environment with sheep positions and map dimensions consistent. However, sheep behavior is technically dynamic for two reasons. They can be lured with wheat but can choose to ignore wheat. Sheep may also move around aimlessly and end up at different locations than where they were spawned.
